			<h2><a id="expansioncards">Expansion Cards Today and their Future</a></h2>
			<p>Expansion cards are very important to users because they allow them to add features that are not present on a PC according
			to their needs. No matter how technology improves, there will always be extra components that some users will need for better performance
			since companies cannot improve every feature on a PC as it will become too expensive and some users won't even require 
			those features.For that reason, expansion cards will not disappear in the near future, however, the importance of certain expansion cards are higher than
			others. The disappearance of certain expansion cards has already begun. Some features such as audio in the past was very poor, so many users
			needed to buy a sound card for their PC. Today, however, the integrated sound system has improved a lot, so the built in audio is sufficient for many users.</p>
			<p>Even though many users need expansion cards, many expansion card models from the past won't suffice because PCs have improved a lot in 
			terms of storage, sound, and other features. Because of this, expansion cards must be very high quality for users to want to spend extra money on them.
			There will be some challenges for expansion cards in the future because if they are low quality then people won't want to buy them as 
			computers already offer many features. On the other hand, if they're high quality, then manufacturers will most likely have to increase the price which will also
			affect the interest in buying expansion cards. After all, the purpose of expansion cards are to upgrade computers.</p>

			<h3>Options Today and What to Buy</h3>
			<p>There are a variety of video card options today with manufacturers AMD and Nvidia in the lead. When considering which video card to buy,
			there are a few factors to consider. Firstly, different video cards are designed for different purposes, some are more suitable for gaming while others
			are more suitable for video editing, so it is important to determine what you're doing with your PC. The second factor is the budget. Video cards prices 
			can range from very cheap(at about $100) to super expensive(over $1000), so depending on the budget, your choice of brand and model can differ. The third factor
			is how recent and worthwhile your PC is overall. If the CPU is very weak, then you shouldn't buy a very expensive video card because it won't be able to
			show its performance.</p>
			<h4>Here are some good options for relatively cheap video cards with great performance:</h4>

			<h3>The Future of Video Cards</h3>
			<!--paragraph about the future of video cards-->
			<p>As technology is progressing, integrated graphic chipsets are improving. They are able to play High Definition videos and even handle light
			image and video editing,so many users do not need to buy a dedicated graphics card to have good graphics. This means that graphics card might
			become less mainstream in the future since many users don't require high quality graphics and don't want to spend extra money on dedicated video cards.
			Despite this, graphics cards will not disappear in the future because there are many users that require higher-end graphics which cannot be achieved
			without a dedicated graphics card no matter how much integrated graphic chipsets improve. The reason is because PCs will become too expensive. In addition, some users don't require
			such high quality graphics. Dedicated video cards are also improving and they are becoming more worthwhile. Due to the improvement of integrated graphic 
			chipsets, the price of dedicated video cards will probably be cheaper for their value because manufacturers want to keep it competitive. Therefore, lower level dedicated video 
			cards will probably start to decrease in sales but there will always be space for higher-end video cards.</p>

			<h3>Options Today and How to Buy</h3>
			<p>There are many sound card options today with prices ranging from approximately $50 to over $200. Depending on the purpose of your PC, the importance
			of sound cards can vary. Before buying a sound card you should consider what purpose you are using your PC for and do you need ultra high sound quality.
			Most PCs today have very good audio already, so if you don't require very high quality audio, then you should think twice about buying a sound card. If you
			do need sound cards, here are a few options that might be suitable depending on your budget.</p>

			<h3>The Future of Sound Cards</h3>
			<!--paragraph about the future of sound cards-->
			<p>There has been a large decrease in users who use dedicated sound cards today compared to the past. A few decades back when computers were first released, the audio
			quality was horrible, users needed to buy a dedicated sound card to have good sound. Today, the audio integrated in the motherboard is sufficient for
			most users. Only users with high demands for high quality sound or work primarily on music would really buy sound cards. In the future, as technology keeps advancing,
			dedicated sound cards will probably almost disappear. Even if they are still available, low quality sound cards would probably die because there is no need for them and 
			high quality sound cards' prices will probably decrease because of the lack of demand, but it will be difficult for companies to reduce prices because of
			the lack of sales. Dedicated sound cards probably won't fully disappear in the near future, but they will definitely almost completely disappear from shelves in stores.</p>
