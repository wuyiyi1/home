			<h2><a id="expansioncards">Expansion Cards Today and their Future</a></h2>
			<p>Expansion cards are very important to users because they allow them to add features that are not present on a PC according
			to their needs. No matter how technology improves there are always extra components some users need for better performance and 
			companies cannot improve every feature on a pc because it will become too expensive and some users won't even require those features.
			For that reason expansion cards will not dissapear in the near future however, the importance of certain expansion cards are higher than
			others. The dissapearance of certain expansion cards has already begun. Some features such as audio in the past was very poor so many users
			had to buy a sound card for their PC but today the integrated sound system has improved a lot so, it is sufficient for many users.</p>
			<p>Even though many users need expansion cards, many expansion card models from the past won't suffice because PCs have improved a lot in 
			terms of storage, sound, and other features so expansion cards must be very high quality so that users will want to spend extra money on them.
			There will be some challenges for expansion cards in the future because if they are low quality then people won't want to buy them because 
			computers already offer many features but if it's high quality, then manufacturers most likely have to increase the price which will also
			affect the interest in buying expansion cards. Afterall the purpose of expansion cards are to upgrade computers.</p>

			<h3>Options Today</h3>
			<p>There are a variety of video card options today and many manufacturers with AMD and Nvidia in the lead. When considering which video card to buy,
			there are a few factors to consider. Firstly, different video cards are designed for different purposes, some are more suitable for gaming, while others
			are more suitable for video editing, so it is important to determine what you're doing with your pc. The second factor is the budget. Video cards prices 
			can range from very cheap(at about $100) to very expensive(over $1000) so depending on the budget, your choice of brand and model can differ. The third factor
			is how recent and expensive your pc is overall. If the CPU is very weak, then you shouldn't buy a very expensive video card because it won't be able to
			show its performance.</p>
			<h4>Here are some good options for relatively cheap video cards with great performance:</h4>

			<h3>The Future of Video Cards</h3>
			<p>As technology is progressing, integrated graphic chipsets are improving. They are able to play High Definition videos and even handle light
			image and video editing,so many users do not need to buy a dedicated graphics card to have good graphics. This means that graphics card might
			become less mainstream in the future since many users don't require high quality graphics and don't want to spend extra money on dedicated video cards.
			Despite this, graphics cards will not dissapear in the future because there are many users that require higher-end graphics which cannot be achieved
			without a dedicated graphics card no matter how much integrated graphic chipsets improve because PCs will become to expensive and some users don't require
			such high quality graphics. Dedicated video cards are also improving and they are becoming more and more worth it for their price. Due to the
			improvement of integrated graphic chipsets, the price of dedicated video cards will probably be cheaper for their value because manufacturers want to 
			keep it competitive. Therefore lower level dedicated video cards will probably start to decrease in sales but there will always be space for higher-end 
			video cards.</p>
