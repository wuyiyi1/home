			<h2>What are sound cards?</h2>
			<p>A sound card (also known as an audio card) is an internal expansion card that provides input and output of audio signals to and from a computer 
			under control of computer programs. The functions of sound cards include providing the audio component for multimedia applications such as music 
			composition, editing video or audio, presentation, education and entertainment (games) and video projection. Sound cards are also used for 
			computer-based communication such as voice over IP and teleconferencing.</p>
