			<h2>What are video cards?</h2> 
			<p>A video card (also called a display card, graphics card, display adapter, or graphics adapter) is an expansion card which 
			<b>generates a feed of output images to a display device.</b> It translates binary data from the CPU then <b>processes it into a picture 
			to be visually seen by the computer user</b>. The CPU sends information to the video card about the texts or images used by the 
			different computer programs. The video card creates those things using the pixels on the computer screen and the processed 
			information will turn into texts or images and is sent to the monitor using a cable.</p>

							<li>Not all cards have heat sinks,as some cards are liquid-cooled and early cards did not produce much heat</li>

							<li>placed right next to the GPU and as the GPU creates images, the VRAM holds the data as well as the attributes of 
							these images until it is time to display them</li>
							<li>the memory that temporarily stores the video image is sometimes called the frame buffer and works faster 
					        and provides faster access to data than a typical RAM becuase it can read and write data simultaneously.</li>

					<td class="leftcolumn">Ramdac</td>
					<td>

							<li>The RAMDAC, or random-access-memory digital-to-analog converter converts digital signals to analog signals for use by a 
							computer display that uses analog inputs such as cathode ray tube (CRT) displays</li>
							<li>It is a kind of RAM chip that regulates the functioning of the graphics card</li>
							<li>beacause of growing popularity of digital computer displays and the integration of the RAMDAC onto the GPU die, 
					        it has mostly disappeared as a discrete component.</li>
